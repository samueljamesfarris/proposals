# Holdfast Proposal

## Inventory Management for Chestnut Bridle Leather Products

### Situation
Holdfast is a successful leather goods manufacturer producing equipment and tools targeting photographers.
Holdfast has continued to grow annually, and they have seen increases in all aspects of the business, from sales volume to the sku count of the product line, from marketing to operations.

### Complication
As Holdfast grows, keeping finished goods inventory levels above zero is a consistent challenge, especially with products made from Chestnut Bridle Leather.
With limited forecasting of production demand, raw material and work in progress inventory levels fluctuate and are often managed with ad hoc orders reacting to low inventory levels.
While production labor is outsourced to Speedy's Leatherworks, inventory management responsibilities remain with Holdfast.
Without established inventory management standards, processes, tools, and metrics, Holdfast risks missing sales opportunities with customers while tying up capital unnecessarily with excess raw material or work in progress inventories.

### Resolution
To address these concerns, and ultimately to reduce customer-facing out of stocks, we will conduct a project to produce the following deliverables:

1. A 12-month sales forecast for Chestnut Bridle Leather products
2. Raw material conversion/production yield calculations (e.g. how many 'product x' per leather hide) including a scrap factor
3. Document a schedule of all lead times for each raw material, including standard, expedited, and any discounts for future commitments, if available, as well as order size parameters (e.g. minimum/maximum, discounts, seasonal limitations, etc.)
4. Produce a Bill of Materials (BOM) for each Chestnut Bridle Leather product
5. Document standard production lead times from Speedy's Leatherworks for each Chestnut Bridle Leather product, and any expedited options that may be available
6. Calculate ideal safety stock levels for raw materials and finished goods inventories, and calculate a standard/desired work in progress "reserves" inventory level (including a scrap factor and any over/under production allowances)
7. Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for inventory management practices
8. Determine key inventory metrics for finished goods, work in progress, and raw materials and produce a "scorecard" template for ongoing visibility to inventory management performance
9. Produce a "straw man" production and inventory management tool for measuring and forecasting ongoing production and inventory levels

### Methodology
To accomplish this, we'll need to conduct interviews, analyze sales data, capture production data, contact suppliers, and develop tools.

We'll need to interview:
1. Matt Swaggart
2. Jess (and or temporary replacement)
3. Speedy

We'll need to analyze historical sales data, at least 2018 YTD, and likely 2017 for the identified products, document product construction for BOMs, determine costs associated to raw materials, and sales forecasts (ideally 6 to 12 months forward) for the following products:
1. Money Maker (MM)
2. MM Skinny
3. MM Solo
4. Belt Anchor
5. Belt
6. Camera Leash
7. Adjustable Sliders
8. Quick Detach Slider
9. Sightseer Small
10. Sightseer

Once we have this material, we'll analyze the data and information and produce the deliverables in an iterative process beginning with drafts that will be reviewed and adjusted based on feedback by Matt and the Holdfast team, then subsequent revision and refinement until the final deliverables are prepared and presented.

We'll complete the project by helping to implement any changes, processes, and reporting for the ongoing use and management of these tools.

It will be most likely that ongoing use will have limited value until we can confirm/evaluate our approach, and then expand to the rest of the product line. That said, my belief and expectation is that you'll still experience real value in reduced out of stocks and better raw material inventory management for Chestnut Bridle Leather products as a result of the findings, tools, and processes established by this project.

### Timing
I expect the project to take 6 weeks to complete, estimating approximately 10 to 15 hours of my time weekly. Draft workplan below.

* WK1: Conduct initial interviews and capture/gain access to historical sales data, raw material conversion/production yield values, and capture lead times raw materials.
* WK2: Develop BOMs for each product and document production lead times by Speedy. Analyze data from WK1.
* WK3: With Matt's direct involvement, determine ideal safety stock levels and ongoing inventory management SOPs. Draft metrics and procedures.
* WK4: Draft "scorecard" and "straw man" production and inventory management tool
* WK5: Refinement
* WK6: Implementation

### Cost
If you wanted a lumpsum project amount, I would price this at $10,000.
If you want to pay by the hourly rate, I would estimate the cost to fall within the range from $7000 to $15,000.

I came to those calculations with an hourly rate of $175 and the permutations of 4wks at 10hrs per week for the low calculations, up to 6wks at 15hrs per week on the high calculation. The most likely result is near the middle value of $10,500.

|Calculations |Low  |Middle 1 |Middle 2 |High |
|------------:|:---:|:-------:|:-------:|:---:|
|Hrly Rate|$175 |$175|$175|$175|
|Wkly Hrs|10|10|15|15|
|Wks|4|6|4|6|
|Totals|$7,000|$10,500|$10,500|$15,750|

We can adjust the scope to reduce costs, and if the effort is much easier to capture some of the values, analysis, etc., I am more than happy to adjust the cost. I want to make sure you achieve the value you want out of this type of project, and there is some unknowns about how difficult or easy this will be until we get going.
